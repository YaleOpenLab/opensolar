    description: "This 10 kW system was installed in a Grid-Tied design by CT solar Developers. It has a 15 kW smart solarEdge inverter, and an Itron revenue grade REC meter. The system is roof-mounted on a 55 degree angle on a SE facing view. However, its high efficient Jingko panels provide a 78% efficiency rating."
