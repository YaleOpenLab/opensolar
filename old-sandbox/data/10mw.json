After hurricanes Maria and Irma affected the island of Puerto Rico, the school was out of power for over 6 months. However, it operated as a defacto community shelter since its Parent-Teacher Association is a strong cohesive group in the Aibonito community. The school had an emergency generator and was able to cater to community needs during the aftermath. The most important aspect missing for the school was a resilient telecommunication system to connect with first responders."

The project is a proof-of-concept installation design and developed by the Yale Openlab and the DCI at the MIT Media Lab. The object is to test the interconnection of the system and the internet connected sensors powering simulated payment mechanisms."
